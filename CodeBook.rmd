## Generalities
The tidy dataset which this document describes have been made using a few key 
ideas:

1. The feature names from the original Samsung dataset has been modified according 
to the following standards for column names:

    * All lower case when possible.
    * Descriptive (Diagnosis versus Dx).
    * Not duplicated.
    * Not have underscores or dots or white spaces. 

2. The decriptive activity labels from the original dataset has been kept.

3. **All** features containing *mean* or *std* in their names have been kept.

The reason for all these three choices is more or less the same: ease of relating 
the tidy output dataset to the original input dataset. With regards to the third 
point above, the author belives it is better to incorporate to much than to little.
As discussed [here](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-016/forum/thread?thread_id=50), the project text does not state how many columns should be included.
As a side note, the script in its current form makes it very simple to alter which 
columns to include and which to leave out, as this basically boils down to a regexp 
search.

When describing the contents of the tidy output dataset, the wording is kept as 
close as possible to the descriptions given in the original dataset. As above, 
this is done to make it clear how these values are related to the original dataset. 
**NOTE:** The manner in which all the *mean* and *std* features contained in the 
tidy output dataset were originally sampled and pre-processed is described in 
the files README.txt and features_info.txt of the original dataset.
